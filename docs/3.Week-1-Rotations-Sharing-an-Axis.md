# 360 Variation

This 360 variation uses more of a ballroom frame to create an elegant feel. It’s a great option to use during the intro and verse of the song, especially if the energy of the music is slow, smooth or romantic.

# Back Spot Turn Exit: Inside Turn

This back spot turn exit is one of my favorites. It uses an overturn to change directions, creating a fun dynamic energy.

It’s a prefect for when the music is high energy.

# Week 1 Challenge

Film a video social dancing together and play with the following:
- Use this week’s moves

- Interpret the music: use simple and smooth variations during the intro and verse, then increase the energy and dynamism of your variations in the montuno section.

Share your video in the whatsapp group and Dojo FB group to show off your progress and inspire others!
It’s about progress, not perfection. Celebrate that and have fun!
