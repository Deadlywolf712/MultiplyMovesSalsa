# Outside Tosses

Multiply Your Moves > Outside Tosses

Since hand toss movements go with the movement of your body, reviewing the body movement module (volume 2) is highly recommended. It won't just make your hand tosses easier, it will improve your overall technique as well. Great body movement makes your partner work smoother, more rhythmical and easier to follow.

You don't just look good, you feel better to your partners.
