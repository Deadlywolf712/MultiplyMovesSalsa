# Week 3 Challenge

For this week's challenge choose a slower song to start with. Checks and overturns are tricky when the music is fast!

With slower music some direction changes can feel quite relaxed, so I'll leave it to you to decide where in the song you feel they fit well. You could use a simple variation early in the song and a more complex version or exit later on.

- Practice executing your direction changes smoothly
- Add in Week 1 and 2 material, rotations and back to back stuff, as you social dance.
