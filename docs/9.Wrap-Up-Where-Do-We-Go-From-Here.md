Multiply Your Moves > Outro & Ideas for Continuing Your Training

Congratulations! We're super proud of all the progress you've made.

And don't think this is goodbye. Grab your partner because this was just the beginning!

Here are some ideas for continuing your training...

1. Go through the program at least 3 more times: get more repetitions in, clean up your moves by filming yourself and comparing to Pat & Scar or myself and Dayana and internalize the themes from the program.
2. Do the intermediate and advanced combos in the Dojo curriculum until you can execute each cleanly
3. Modify the Dojo combos by mixing them together, or adding your own ideas.
4. Watch some of your favorite dancers on youtube or instagram and see if you can deconstruct what they're doing with your partner
5. Create your own moves or combos using everything you've learned.
6. Practice BODY MOVEMENT - this is the magic of salsa. Practice daily, even just 5 minutes. Use Body Movement Volume 2 in the Dojo course. Body movement is the base for styling and musicality.
