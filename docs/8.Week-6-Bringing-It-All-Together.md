# Problem Solving: Hammerlock Exits

Multiply Your Moves > Problem Solving: Hammerlock Exits

It's time to bring everything you know together and solve some problems!

Combine all the tools you have...
- Your own experience
- Knowledge of basics moves (cross body lead, check, change of place, right turn, left turn, inside turn, outside turn etc.)
- 5 frameworks
- Weekly themes (rotations, back to back, changes of direction, locks & drops, and hand tosses)

And apply them to this challenge...
1. Watch the lesson below and come up with 6-10 solutions for exiting a hammerlock
2. Send us a video.
3. Take a look at how we approach the problem.

Note: follows you can help the leads with ideas too!

**The goal: explore, create and problem solve to solidify neural connections**

# Problem Solving: Inside Turn With Check

Multiply Your Moves > Problem Solving: Inside Turn With Check

Use the 5 frameworks, the weekly themes and the basic moves you know to think of AT LEAST 4-6 variations (or aim high with 10+). You can vary the ENTRANCE or the EXIT (handholds, positions etc.)

You can do either the...
- Inside turn with one check (i.e. the Wrap on1 or Wrap on2) OR
- Inside turn with the two checks (like the video)

Send us a video and then take a look at how we approached the problem.

Note: follows you can help the leads with ideas too! "What if we tried..."

# Problem Solving: Copa

Multiply Your Moves > Problem Solving: Copa

Use the 5 frameworks, the weekly themes and your knowledge of basics moves to think of 4-6 copa variations. You can change the entrance, the amount of checks, the exit - whatever you like!

In case you want to review it, here's the Copa On1 and the Copa On2.

Send us a video and then take a look at how we approach the problem.

# Week 6 Challenge

Multiply Your Moves > Week 6 Challenge

It's time to bring everything you've learned together and social dance!

Not every social dance needs to include EVERYTHING you know, that's just crazy. BUT, as an exercise, do your best to include as much as you've learned as possible while connecting to the music as you go:

- Week 1: rotations
- Week 2: back to back
- Week 3: direction changes (checks + overturns)
- Week 4: locks and drops
- Week 5: hand tosses
- Week 6: vary your exits for common positions

Daya and I did our best to pack in as much of the material we covered as possible into the social dance, but I didn't quite manage to squeeze in any overturns -- maybe next time. Have fun and smile!
