# Lock Technique & Warmup

Multiply Your Moves > Lock Technique & Warmup

Being successful with locks is all about technique, so listen up to the tips we have and then do the warmup exercise at 3:47 (explanation) and 9:47 (demo)

- Stay close to your partner (forearm distance)
- Relax your arms, elbows down
- Trace to maintain connection (when you drop a hand)

**Vocabulary:** a "lock" is when you keep holding on to the hand, a "drop" is when you drop the hand. A "drop" can also be called a "hair brush" when it's over someone's head. A "loop" or "head loop" is just another name for a common lock that goes around the head.
